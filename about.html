      <p>
        I am <b style="color: white">Gerry Iglesias</b>, a Filipino citizen. For the past sixteen
        years, I have lived, worked, and raised a family in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, I have decided to create a photo card grid featuring the locations and
        attractions in Singapore that my family has visited on a regular basis and that have played
        a significant role in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I want to encourage travelers to put Singapore on their bucket list of
        destinations and use my photo card as a recommendation for must-see sights to see and do.
